This program is designed for basketball fans who want to deep dive into NBA stats. So much of the conversation around basketball today is about keeping track of stats and records and comparing current and former players. Often, we use these stats to back up our claims. Therefore, this app intends to create a fun and approachable way to follow and understand NBA analytics to hopefully someday sound like the experts you see on TV.
